## Developer Certificate of Origin

The sign-off is a simple signature at the end of the description for the patch.
Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right
to pass it on as an open-source patch.

The rules are pretty simple, and sign-off means that you certify the DCO below
(from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):
